# Confidence Intervals for Selected Parameters

This is a supplementary code to "Confidence Intervals for Selected Parameters", by Yoav Benjamini, Yotam Hechtlinger and Philip B. Stark.

The following scripts are included in the repository:
* *plot_2d_abs.R* - visualize the acceptance regions for the selection of the absolute maximum in 2D and generate figure 2.
* *2d_abs_upper_bound.R* - calculate the upper bound for the selection of the absolute maximum in 2D and generate figure 3.
* *intervals_comparisons.py* - evaluate the coverage of several methods and generates figures 4 and 5.
* *dependency_simulations.py* - perform dependency simulations and generate figure 11. 
* *calculate_intervals.py* - compute the different intervals for the selection of k out of m.
